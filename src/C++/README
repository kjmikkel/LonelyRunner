===Build instructions===

The project has a few dependencies - see below. Once the dependencies have been installed and configured, you will only need to call

make 

or 

make LonelyRunner.out

or if you want the test program

make TestCode.out

The resulting output can be run normaly

===Compilers and portability===

For this project I have compiled the code with gcc version 4.4.3 (Ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu). 

I have tried to use  compliant code, though when it comes to testing, there may be problem with running on other platforms than Linux (primarily when it comes to getting the time).
