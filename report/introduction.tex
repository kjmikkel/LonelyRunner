The Lonely Runner conjecture states that given 

The most succinct description I have seen of the problem is found in \cite{ANote} which has the following description of the problem:\\

Given any n positive integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$, there is a real number $x$ such that 
\eqn{
\label{mainProb} \Vert w_i x\Vert \geq \frac{1}{n+1}
}

for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, where for a real number $x$, $\Vert x \Vert$ is the distance from $x$ from the nearest integer.

There exist 2 equivalent interpretations of this, which are more colourful, and which are used in almost all of the articles detailing the Lonely Runner problem, I have surveyed:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume there are $n$ runners at a circular, unit length, track, where every runner runs with a constant, pairwise different speeds\footnote{These speeds can, without loss of generality be assumed to be in $\N$ \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}}, there will then be a time when all runners will be at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ distance away from the start line.\\

\item Alternatively, imagine we have n + 1 runners, and then the conjecture states that there exists a point in time where all the runners are at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their nearest runner, everything else is the same as in the first interpretation \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}.\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\label{scope}
\todo{Scope and limitations}
In this project I will not attempt to prove the Lonely Runner conjecture for all n. 
I will work to make the program return a result within a reasonable time, for up to 1000 runners. While the final program should work with more than 1000 runners, I will not try to optimize the program further. The program will include an interactive counterexample search system.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\label{expectations}
\todo{Expectations}
I expect the reader to be able to understand the Lonely Runner Conjecture in all its formulations, as well as being mathematically mature, and having a basic understanding of Plane Sweep algorithms.

\subsection{Terminology}
\label{Termonolgy}
In this report I will refer to the track interval [$\frac{1}{n + 1}$: $\frac{n}{n+1}$] as the \zone, and a runner who is in this interval, as being in the \zone.

\subsection{Background material used}
\label{background}
For this project I have used ``Computational Geometry'' \cite{citeulike:3347056} and Algebra \todo{Fix cite to Algebra by Anders Thorup}
