\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
The Lonely Runner conjecture was first stated by J. M. Wills in \cite{JMWills}, where it was presented as a purely formal problem in the field of Diophantine approximation. It remained so until 1998, where it was given its more memorable name, and intuitive interpretation, from \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}. As of 2010 the Lonely Runner conjecture has only been proved for up to n = 6 \cite{serra_thelonely}.

There exist several equivalent interpretations of the Lonely Runner conjecture, and I will here state widely used versions\footnote{See \cite{ANote}}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Imagine $n$ runners at a circular, unit length track\footnote{i.e. the track has a circumference of 1}, where every runner runs with constant, pairwise different speeds\footnote{These speeds can, without loss of generality be assumed to be in $\N$ - see \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions} and Section \ref{integerSpeeds}}, there will then exist a time t where all runners will be at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their common start-point.\\

\item Imagine we have n + 1 runners, then the conjecture states that for every runner there exists a time where all other runners are at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from it. Everything else is the same as in the first interpretation \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}.\\
\end{enumerate}

More formally the problem can be stated thus: 
Given any n positive integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$, there exists a real number $x$ such that 
\eqn{
\label{eqa:lonelyRunner} \Vert w_i x\Vert \geq \frac{1}{n+1}
}

for $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, where for $y \in \R$, $\Vert y \Vert$ is the distance from $y$ to the nearest integer. I owe the above formulations of the conjecture to \cite{ANote}. In this report it is useful to think of the track as the one-dimensional Torus $\mathbb{T} = [0,1)$.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\todo{Expectations}
I expect the reader to have the mathematical knowledge required to understand both the formal and informal description of the Lonely Runner Conjecture, as well as having read Computational Geometry on the level of \cite{citeulike:3347056} or similar.

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\todo{Scope and limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this project I will not attempt to prove the Lonely Runner conjecture for all n. 
\item I will create a program that can verify whether a given configuration of runners is true for \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner}, and make it return a result, within a reasonable time, for up to 1000 runners. The final program will work with more than 1000 runners, but I will prioritise readability, maintainability and portability of the program instead of extreme optimizations. 
\item The program will include a system to test a range of runner configurations against \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner}.
\item I will only focus on runners with integer speeds - see \ref{integerSpeeds} for an justification of this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computer specifications}
\label{specs}
I would like to define which kind of computer I would require for running my program. As mentioned above, the Lonely Runner conjecture has direct applications for View-Obstruction problems and coloring of regular chromatic graphs. Researchers working with in these fields have no special reason to work with exceedingly powerful computers, or computers with special hardware.
 
Based on the above I would argue that any algorithm I devise and implement should be able to run on a standard computer with no special hardware\footnote{Say hardware dedicated to fast floating point calculations}. I will therefore design my verification program to run on a 2 Ghz computer with the recommended amount of RAM for the computer's OS. 

I reserve the right to use third-party software libraries - as long as these can be freely distributed and installed.

\subsection{Integer speeds}
\label{integerSpeeds}
In this section I will prove that my program will only have to work with integer speeds.
Let us assume for a given configuration of runner speeds T, there is a non-empty set $S \subset T$, of runner speeds that are not integers. Since we are dealing with the speeds of runners, it is clear that it only makes sense either all elements in S belong to $\mathbb{Q}$ or where at least one of the elements in S is a irrational number:
\begin{description}
\item[Only rational numbers in S:] In this instance we can convert all the runner speeds into integers, by multiplying all speeds in T with the product of the denominators of the rational numbers in S.
\item[Only irrational numbers in S, and S = T:]

\item[T is a mixture of natural/rational numbers and irrational numbers:]

\end{description}

\subsection{Terminology}

  \caption{\label{circleZoneImg}An illustration of the Runner track. The grayed out part is the Zone}
\end{figure}

In this report I will refer to runners as male for simplicity.

\begin{defi}
\label{def:theZone}
In this report I will refer to the track interval [$\frac{1}{n + 1}$, $\frac{n}{n+1}$] as the Zone, and a runner who is in this interval, as ``being in the Zone''. see figure \ref{circleZoneImg} for an illustration of the Zone.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
\label{def:config}
Configurations of runners, will in this report refer to a set S of $n \in \N$ runners, where for all runners $r, r\prime \in S$, $r \neq r\prime$, $r_{speed}, r\prime_{speed} \in \N$, and $r_{speed} \neq r\prime_{speed}$.
\end{defi}

\hide{
\begin{defi}
\label{def:fakeRunner}
When talking about the fake runner, I will be referring to a runner that is not actually in race, but rather a runner with speed 1, who I have introduced in order to have a convenient termination criterion for the Geometrical algorithm\footnote{\pref{compGeo}}. \pref{termination} for more.
\end{defi}  
}
\subsection{Canonical example}
Through the rest of this report I will use the following configuration
of runners to give an example:
We have 4 runners with the speeds of 3, 5, 6, 9

\subsection{Background material used}
\label{background}
For this project I have read the following papers dealing with the Lonely Runner conjecture: ``View-Obstruction Problems''\cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}, ``The lonely runner problem with seven runners'' \cite{serra_thelonely}, ``Regular chromatic number and the lonely runner problem'' \cite{Barajas2007479}, ``View-Obstruction Problems'' \cite{springerlink:10.1007/BF01832623}, ``Tight Instances of the Lonely Runner'' \cite{Goddyn96tightinstances}, ``A Note on the Lonely Runner Conjecture'' \cite{ANote} and ``Invisible runners in finite fields'' \cite{invis}.

I have also used the follow support literature:
``Computational Geometry'' \cite{citeulike:3347056}, ``Uniform Distribution of Sequences'' \cite{uniform} and ``Kalkulus'' \cite{kalkulus}.
