The Lonely Runner conjecture states that given 

The most succinct description I have seen of the problem is found in \cite{ANote} which has the following description of the problem:\\

Given any n positive integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$, there is a real number $x$ such that 
\eqn{
\label{mainProb} \Vert w_i x\Vert \geq \frac{1}{n+1}
}

for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, where for a real number $x$, $\Vert x \Vert$ is the distance from $x$ from the nearest integer.

There exist 2 equivalent descriptions, which are more colourful:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Assume there are $n$ runners at a circular, unit length, track, where every runner runs with a constant,  pairwise different speeds\footnote{These speeds can, without loss of generality can be assumed to be in $\N$ \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}}\todo{Should I instead point to Zwei Sate uber inhomogene diophntische Approximation von Irrationalzahlen instead?}, there will then be a time where all the runners are at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ distance away from the start line.\\

\item Instead of n runners, we now have n + 1 runners, then the conjecture states that there exists a point in time where all the runners are at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their nearest runner, everything else is the same as in the first example \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}.\\
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\label{scope}
\todo{Scope and limitations}
In this project I will not attempt to prove the Lonely Runner conjecture for all n. 
I will work to make the program return a result within a reasonable time, for up to 1000 runners. While the final program should work with more than 1000 runners, no time garantiues will be made for very large numbers (say, 10.000 runners).
The program will include an interactive counterexample search system.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\label{expectations}
\todo{Expectations}
I expect the reader to be able to understand the Lonely Runner Conjecture in all its formulations, as well as being mathematically mature.

\subsection{Terminology}
\label{Termonolgy}
In this report I will refer to the track interval [$\frac{1}{n + 1}$: $\frac{n}{n+1}$] as the \zone, and a runner who is in this interval, as being in the \zone.

\subsection{Background material used}
