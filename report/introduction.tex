\section{Introduction}
\label{introduction}
The Lonely runner conjecture was first stated by J. M. Wills in \cite{JMWills}, where it was presented as a purely formal problem in the field of diophantine approximation. It remained so until 1998, where it got its current name, and intuitive interpretation, from \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}. As of 2010 the Lonely Runner conjecture has only been proven for up to n = 6.

There exist 2 equivalent interpretations of the Lonely Runner conjecture that are widely used\footnote{See \cite{ANote}}:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Imagine $n$ runners at a circular, unit length track\footnote{i.e. the track has a circumference of 1}, where every runner runs with constant, pairwise different speeds\footnote{These speeds can, without loss of generality be assumed to be in $\N$ \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions} - also see \ref{integerSpeeds}}, there will then exist a time t where all runners will be at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their common start-point.\\

\item Alternatively, imagine that we instead have n + 1 runners, then the conjecture states that there exists a point in time where all the runners are at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their nearest runner. Everything else is the same as in the first interpretation \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}.\\
\end{enumerate}

More formally the problem can be stated thus: 
Given any n positive integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$, there is a real number $x$ such that 
\eqn{
\label{eqa:lonelyRunner} \Vert w_i x\Vert \geq \frac{1}{n+1}
}

for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, where for a real number $y$, $\Vert y \Vert$ is the distance from $x$ from the nearest integer. I owe this formulation of the problem to \cite{ANote}.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\todo{Expectations}
I expect the reader to have the mathamatical knowledge required to understand both the formal and informal description of the Lonely Runner Conjecture, as well as having a basic understanding of the principles behind computational geometry\footnote{See ``Computational Geometry'' \cite{citeulike:3347056} or similar University level textbook}.

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\todo{Scope and limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this project I will not attempt to prove the Lonely Runner conjecture for all n. 
\item I will create a program that can verify whether a given configuration of runners is true for \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner}, and make it return a result, within a reasonable time, for up to 1000 runners. The final program will work with more than 1000 runners, but I will prioratise readability, maintainability and portability for the program instead of extreeme optimizations. 
\item The program will include a system to test a range of runner configurations against \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner}.
\item I will only focus on runners with integer speeds - see \ref{integerSpeeds} for an justification of this.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Computer specifications}
\label{specs}
Before I go any further I would like to define which kind of computer I would require for running the solutions I come up with. As mentioned above, the Lonely Runner Problem has direct applications for View-Obstruction problems and coloring of regular chromatic graphs. None of people working with these fields have any special reason to work with any a exceedingly powerful computer, or computers with special hardware.
 
Based on the above I would argue that any algorithm I devise and implement should be able to run on a standard computer with no special hardware (say hardware dedicated to fast floating point calculations). The minimum specs for the computer therefore becomes a 2 Ghz computer with more than 2 GB over the recommended amount of RAM for the OS the computer is running. 

I do however reserve the right to make it depend on the third-party software libraries - as long as these can be freely distributed and installed.

\subsection{Integer speeds}
\label{integerSpeeds}
In this section I will argue that I need only focus on integer speeds.
Let us assume for a given configuration of runner speeds T, there is a non-empty set $S \subset T$, of runner speeds that are not integers. Since we are dealing with the speeds of runners, it is clear that it only makes sense either all elements in S belong to $\mathbb{Q}$ or where at least one of the elements in S is a irrational number:
\begin{description}
\item[Only rational numbers in S:] In this instance we can convert all the runner speeds into integers, by multiplying all speeds in T with the product of the denominators of the rational numbers in S.
\item[Only irrational numbers in S, and S = T:]

\item[T is a mixture of natural/rational numbers and irrational numbers:]

\end{description}

\subsection{Terminology}

  \caption{\label{circleZoneImg}An illustration of the Runner track. The grayed out part is the Zone}
\end{figure}

When forced to use a pronoun by the English language, I will use the male pronoun to the refer to the runners. This is done purely for convenience, and to make the text flow better.

\begin{defi}
\label{def:theZone}
In this report I will refer to the track interval [$\frac{1}{n + 1}$, $\frac{n}{n+1}$] as the Zone, and a runner who is in this interval, as ``being in the Zone''. see figure \ref{circleZoneImg} for an illustration of the Zone.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
\label{def:config}
Configurations of runners, will in this report refer to a set S of $n \in \N$ runners, where for all runners $r, r\prime \in S$, $r \neq r\prime$, $r_{speed}, r\prime_{speed} \in \N$, and $r_{speed} \neq r\prime_{speed}$.
\end{defi}

\begin{defi}
\label{def:fakeRunner}
When talking about the fake runner, I will be referring to a runner that is not actually in race, but rather a runner with speed 1, who I have introduced in order to have a convenient termination criterion for the Geometrical algorithm\footnote{See section \ref{compGeo} on page \pageref{compGeo}}. See section \ref{termination} page \pageref{termination} for an elaboration for the reasons behind it.
\end{defi}  

\subsection{Canonical example}
Through the rest of this report I will use the following configuration
of runners to give an example:
We have 4 runners with the speeds of 3, 5, 6, 9

\subsection{Background material used}
\label{background}
For this project I have read the following papers dealing with the Lonely Runner conjecture: ``View-Obstruction Problems''\cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}, ``The lonely runner problem with seven runners'' \cite{serra_thelonely}, ``Regular chromatic number and the lonely runner problem'' \cite{Barajas2007479}, ``View-Obstruction Problems'' \cite{springerlink:10.1007/BF01832623}, ``Tight Instances of the Lonely Runner'' \cite{Goddyn96tightinstances}, ``A Note on the Lonely Runner Conjecture'' \cite{ANote} and ``Invisible runners in finite fields'' \cite{invis}.

I have also used the follow support literature:
``Computational Geometry'' \cite{citeulike:3347056}, ``Uniform Distribution of Sequences'' \cite{uniform} and ``Kalkulus'' \cite{kalkulus}.
