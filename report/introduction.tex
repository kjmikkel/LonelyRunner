\todo{Introduction}

There exist 2 equivalent interpretations of the Lonely Runner conjecture that are widely used:\todo{have a footnote where it was named}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Imagine $n$ runners at a circular, unit length track\footnote{I.E. the track has a circumference of 1}, where every runner runs with a constant, pairwise different speeds\footnote{These speeds can, without loss of generality be assumed to be in $\N$ \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}}, there will then be a time when all runners will be at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their common start-point.\\

\item Alternatively, imagine that we instead have n + 1 runners, then the conjecture states that there exists a point in time where all the runners are at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ units away from their nearest runner. Everything else is the same as in the first interpretation \cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}.\\
\end{enumerate}

More formally the problem can be stated thus: 
Given any n positive integers $w_1, w_2, \ldots, w_n$, there is a real number $x$ such that 
\eqn{
\label{eqa:lonelyRunner} \Vert w_i x\Vert \geq \frac{1}{n+1}
}

for each $i = 1, 2, \ldots, n$, where for a real number $y$, $\Vert y \Vert$ is the distance from $x$ from the nearest integer. I owe this formulation of the problem to \cite{ANote}.

\subsection{Expectations to the reader}
\label{expectations}
\todo{Expectations}
I expect the reader to be able to understand the Lonely Runner Conjecture in all its formulations, as well as being mathematically mature, and having a basic understanding of Plane Sweep algorithms.

\subsection{Scope and Limitations}
\label{scope}
\todo{Scope and limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this project I will not attempt to prove the Lonely Runner conjecture for all n. 
\item I will work to make the program return a result within a reasonable time, for up to 1000 runners, and with speeds up to 1000. The final program should work with more than 1000 runners, and with speeds in excess to 1000, but I will not optimise it further. \item The program will include an interactive counterexample search system.
\item I will only focus on runners with \todo{ask Jakob about this}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Terminology}
\label{Termonolgy}
In this report I will refer to the track interval [$\frac{1}{n + 1}$, $\frac{n}{n+1}$] as the Zone, and a runner who is in this interval, as ``being in the Zone''.

When forced to use a pronoun by the English language, I will use the male pronoun to the refer to the runners. This is done purely for convenience, and to make the text flow better. Not because I believe that male runners are more numerous or in any way inherently better than female runners.

Configurations of runners, will in this report refer to a set S of $n \in \N$ runners, where for all runners $r \in S$, $r_{speed} \in \N$, and $r\prime_{speed} \neq r_{speed}$ where $r\prime \in S \setminus r$.

When talking about the fake runner, I will be referring to a runner that is not actually in race (or any attempt to find a value that would make the Lonely Runner conjecture valid for the given configuration of runners), but rather a runner that has been introduced for convince.   

\subsection{Background material used}
\label{background}
For this project I have read the following papers dealing with the Lonely Runner conjecture: ``View-Obstruction Problems''\cite{Bienia97flows.view-obstructions}, ``The lonely runner problem with seven runners'' \cite{serra_thelonely}, ``Regular chromatic number and the lonely runner problem'' \cite{Barajas2007479}, ``View-Obstruction Problems'' \cite{springerlink:10.1007/BF01832623}, ``Tight Instances of the Lonely Runner'' \cite{Goddyn96tightinstances}, ``A Note on the Lonely Runner Conjecture'' \cite{ANote} and ``Invisible runners in finite fields'' \cite{invis}.

I have also used the follow support literature:
``Computational Geometry'' \cite{citeulike:3347056} Algebra \todo{Fix cite to Algebra by Anders Thorup}, and ``Kalkulus'' \cite{kalkulus}.
