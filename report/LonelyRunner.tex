\abstract{
The Lonely Runner conjecture states that given n runners (where $n \in \N$, and all the runners have pairwise different speeds), there will be a time where every runner will be at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ distance away from their common start position. The conjecture has been proved up to n = 6\cite{serra_thelonely}. Since the Lonely Runner conjecture has applications in both Graph theory, number theory, and View-Obstruction problems, it would be nice if it could be proved for all n. In this project I have tried to experimentally verify the conjecture to up to 1000 runners \todo{When I have results fill this out}
