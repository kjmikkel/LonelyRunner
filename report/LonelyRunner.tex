\abstract{
  The Lonely Runner conjecture states that given n runners, with pairwise distinct speeds, there will be a time where every runner will be at least $\frac{1}{n + 1}$ distance away from their common start position. The conjecture has been proved up to n = 6 (see \cite{serra_thelonely}). Since the Lonely Runner conjecture has applications in both Graph theory, number theory, and View-Obstruction problems, it would be preferable if it could be proved for all n, so that these research areas could utilize the properties of the conjecture without any reservations. In this project I have implemented the Numerical algorithm found in \cite{invis} and a Geometrical algorithm of my own devising, in order to create a program that can verify whether or not there is a time where the runner speeds fulfills the conjecture (and report the time), as well as a tool to test the conjecture for a range of runner speeds. As a direct application of this program I have verified all possible runner speeds with 20 runners up to a  maximum speed of \maxNumbers.
