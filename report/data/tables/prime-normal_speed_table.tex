The Numerical algorithm is faster by 413274000 $\mu$s (or 6.90 minutes) compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 466112964 $\mu$s (or 7.74 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 3 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 3, out of 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)\\
