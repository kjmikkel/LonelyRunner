The Numerical algorithm is faster by 494237307 $\mu$s (or 8.22 minutes) compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 488629818 $\mu$s (or 8.16 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 2 calculations that took more than 1 second out of 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)\\
