The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 494237307 $\mu$s (or 8.22 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 488629818 $\mu$s (or 8.16 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 2 calculations that took more than 1 second using 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)}\label{prime-random_speedtable}\end{table}
