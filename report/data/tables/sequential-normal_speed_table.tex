\caption{Sorted Sequential Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 16835948670 $\mu$s (or 4.68 hours).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 52958335 $\mu$s (or 52.9 seconds), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 15 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 15, using 3 data sets (with a total of 14984 data points)\\
