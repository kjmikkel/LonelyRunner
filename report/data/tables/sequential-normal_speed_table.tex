The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 16835948670 $\mu$s (or 4.68 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 52958335 $\mu$s (or 52.9 seconds), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 15 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 15, out of 3 data sets (with a total of 14984 data points)\\
