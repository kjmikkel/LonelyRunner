\caption{Random Random Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 2572263249 $\mu$s (or 42.9 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 737465384 $\mu$s (or 12.3 minutes), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 326 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 47, using 5 data sets (with a total of 24924 data points)\\
