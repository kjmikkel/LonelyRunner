The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 907511307 $\mu$s (or 15.1 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 954742782 $\mu$s (or 15.9 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 5 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 3, using 20 data sets (with a total of 13448 data points)\\
