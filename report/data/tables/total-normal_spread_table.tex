The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 1425481 $\mu$s (or 1.43 seconds) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread by 605399 $\mu$s (or 0.606 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 18 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 18, out of 13 data sets (with a total of 21708 data points)\\
