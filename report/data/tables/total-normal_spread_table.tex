The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 449460 $\mu$s (or 0.450 seconds).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 3122087 $\mu$s (or 3.12 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 73 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 73, using 18 data sets (with a total of 46632 data points)\\
