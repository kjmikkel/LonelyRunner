The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 166749 $\mu$s (or 0.167 seconds) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 105786 $\mu$s (or 0.106 seconds), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 47 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 47, out of 5 data sets (with a total of 24924 data points)\\
