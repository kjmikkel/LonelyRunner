\caption{Random Random Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 166749 $\mu$s (or 0.167 seconds).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 105786 $\mu$s (or 0.106 seconds), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 47 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 47, using 5 data sets (with a total of 24924 data points)\\
