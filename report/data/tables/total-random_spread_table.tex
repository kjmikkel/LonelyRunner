\caption{Random  Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 3743463649 $\mu$s (or 1.04 hours).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 709556582 $\mu$s (or 11.8 minutes), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 330 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 55, using 18 data sets (with a total of 46632 data points)\\
