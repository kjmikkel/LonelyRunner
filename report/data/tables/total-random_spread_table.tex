The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 4908883672 $\mu$s (or 1.36 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread by 709765838 $\mu$s (or 11.8 minutes), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 343 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 69, out of 19 data sets (with a total of 51612 data points)\\
