The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 29788225 $\mu$s (or 29.8 seconds).\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 26794082 $\mu$s (or 26.8 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 3 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 4, using 20 data sets (with a total of 13448 data points)\\
