\caption{Sorted Random Results\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 976021 $\mu$s (or 0.978 seconds).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 2516688 $\mu$s (or 2.51 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 55 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 55, using 5 data sets (with a total of 24924 data points)\\
