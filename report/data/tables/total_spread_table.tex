The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 4910309153 $\mu$s (or 1.36 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread by 710371237 $\mu$s (or 11.8 minutes), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 361 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 87, out of 32 data sets (with a total of 73320 data points)\\
