The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 3743913109 $\mu$s (or 1.04 hours).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 712678669 $\mu$s (or 11.9 minutes), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 403 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 128, using 36 data sets (with a total of 93264 data points)\\
