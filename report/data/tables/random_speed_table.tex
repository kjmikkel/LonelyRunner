The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 675715349 $\mu$s (or 11.3 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 661976099 $\mu$s (or 11.0 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 401 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 102, using 10 data sets (with a total of 49848 data points)\\
