The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 17926645778 $\mu$s (or 4.98 hours).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 1719187982 $\mu$s (or 28.7 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 425 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 124, using 36 data sets (with a total of 93264 data points)\\
