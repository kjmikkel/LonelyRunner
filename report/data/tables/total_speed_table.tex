The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 42972505816 $\mu$s (or 11.9 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 1131061476 $\mu$s (or 18.8 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 84 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 82, out of 32 data sets (with a total of 73320 data points)\\
