The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 18158441736 $\mu$s (or 5.04 hours).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 102469101 $\mu$s (or 1.71 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 19 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 19, using 6 data sets (with a total of 29968 data points)\\
