The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 43879850374 $\mu$s (or 12.2 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 176212908 $\mu$s (or 2.93 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 32 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 32, out of 7 data sets (with a total of 34948 data points)\\
