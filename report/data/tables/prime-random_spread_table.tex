The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 29845999 $\mu$s (or 29.8 seconds) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 27352877 $\mu$s (or 27.4 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm produced 1 spread that is larger than 1 second out of 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)\\
