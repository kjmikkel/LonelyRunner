The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 29845999 $\mu$s (or 29.8 seconds).\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 27352877 $\mu$s (or 27.4 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Numerical algorithm produced 1 spread that is larger than 1 second using 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)}\label{prime-random_spreadtable}\end{table}
