The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 675548600 $\mu$s (or 11.3 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 661870313 $\mu$s (or 11.0 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 354 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 55, using 5 data sets (with a total of 24924 data points)\\
