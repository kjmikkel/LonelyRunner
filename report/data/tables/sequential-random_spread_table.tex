\caption{Random Sequential Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 1141354401 $\mu$s (or 19.0 minutes).\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 555925 $\mu$s (or 0.554 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 4 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 7, using 3 data sets (with a total of 14984 data points)\\
