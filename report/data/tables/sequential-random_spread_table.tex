The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 2306774424 $\mu$s (or 38.5 minutes) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 346669 $\mu$s (or 0.347 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 17 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 21, out of 4 data sets (with a total of 19964 data points)\\
