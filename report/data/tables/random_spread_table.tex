The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 2571287228 $\mu$s (or 42.8 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 739982072 $\mu$s (or 12.4 minutes), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 381 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 102, using 10 data sets (with a total of 49848 data points)\\
