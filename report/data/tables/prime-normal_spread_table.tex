The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread by 57774 $\mu$s (or 0.0576 seconds) compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread by 558795 $\mu$s (or 0.558 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 3 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 3, out of 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)\\
