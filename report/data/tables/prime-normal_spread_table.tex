\caption{Sorted Prime Results\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 57774 $\mu$s (or 0.0576 seconds).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 558795 $\mu$s (or 0.558 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 3 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 3, using 10 data sets (with a total of 6724 data points)\\
