\caption{Sorted Sequential Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 1483255 $\mu$s (or 1.48 seconds).\\
The Numerical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Geometrical algorithm by 46604 $\mu$s (or 0.0464 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 15 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 15, using 3 data sets (with a total of 14984 data points)\\
