\caption{Complete Sequential Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 1142837656 $\mu$s (or 19.0 minutes).\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread than the Numerical algorithm by 509321 $\mu$s (or 0.508 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 19 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 22, using 6 data sets (with a total of 29968 data points)\\
