The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 2308257679 $\mu$s (or 38.5 minutes) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm has a lesser spread by 300065 $\mu$s (or 0.300 seconds), if we disregard every spread that is larger than 1 second, compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 32 spreads that is larger than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 36, out of 7 data sets (with a total of 34948 data points)\\
