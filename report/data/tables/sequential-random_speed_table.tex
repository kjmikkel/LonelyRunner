\caption{Random Sequential Results\\
The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 1322493066 $\mu$s (or 22.0 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 49510766 $\mu$s (or 49.7 seconds), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 4 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 4, using 3 data sets (with a total of 14984 data points)\\
