The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 27043901704 $\mu$s (or 7.51 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 123254573 $\mu$s (or 2.05 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 17 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 17, out of 4 data sets (with a total of 19964 data points)\\
