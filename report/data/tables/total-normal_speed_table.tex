The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 16422674670 $\mu$s (or 4.56 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 519071299 $\mu$s (or 8.64 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 18 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 18, out of 13 data sets (with a total of 21708 data points)\\
