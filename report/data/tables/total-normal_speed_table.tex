The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 17098223270 $\mu$s (or 4.75 hours).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 1180941612 $\mu$s (or 19.7 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 372 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 73, using 18 data sets (with a total of 46632 data points)\\
