The Geometrical algorithm is faster than the Numerical algorithm by 828422508 $\mu$s (or 13.8 minutes).\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical algorithm by 538246370 $\mu$s (or 9.00 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 53 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 51, using 18 data sets (with a total of 46632 data points)\\
