The Geometrical algorithm is faster by 26549831146 $\mu$s (or 7.37 hours) compared to the Numerical algorithm.\\
The Numerical algorithm is faster by 611990177 $\mu$s (or 10.2 minutes), if we disregard every calculation that took more than 1 second, compared to the Geometrical algorithm.\\
The Geometrical algorithm produced 66 calculations that took more than 1 second, while the Numerical algorithm produced 64, out of 19 data sets (with a total of 51612 data points)\\
