\subsection{Introduction}
In this section I will show and discuss the most important results I have found while testing the Geometrical and Numerical algorithms. 

I will first show, and comment, on the most important graphs generated by the result of having run the Numerical and the Geometrical algorithms on the 3 data-sets detailed in the last section.

After that I will show the speed and spread tables for all 3 data-sets, as well as the combined results for all these data-sets. I will then comment on these results, and try to draw some conclusions. The format for each tables is that I will first have the tables themselves, then mentioned which of the algorithms produced the best results (and how much faster they were than the other solution). If there are individual data points that takes longer/has a larger spread than 1 second, then there will there will be 2 version of the above data: One where these extreme cases are included, and one where they are not. 

The complete, machine-readable, data-sets can be found in this projects github repository at \underline{https://github.com/kjmikkel/LonelyRunner}, in the src/data folder.

When a graph in the following contains a hyphenated ``Random'' in its title, it means that while both the Geometrical and the Numerical algorithm has been given the same input, the order of the input for the Numerical algorithm has been randomized. 

\subsection{Interesting Graphs}

%\graph{Primes-Random}{1000}{Geo}{}

\subsubsection{Sequential Numbers}
Figure \ref{Sequential_100_Num} and \ref{Sequential_100_Geo} is the same figure, just with different ranges on the y-axis.

\graph{Sequential}{100}{Num}{The time anomaly for the Numerical algorithm is very clear}
\graph{Sequential}{100}{Geo}{We can see, that once the anomaly is over, the Numerical algorithm is clearly faster than the Geometrical algorithm}

The above pattern is one that appears every time the input is Sequential, but only for the first configuration.

\subsubsection{Sequential-Random}
\graph{Sequential-Random}{100}{Num}{Please note the very large Error bar, which is not present in figure \ref{Sequential_100_Num}. This is because of randomized order of the input}


%\graph{Sequential-Random}{1000}{Num}{}
%\graph{Sequential-Random}{1000}{Geo}{}
\graph{Sequential-Random}{2000}{Num}{This graph is very interesting because it shows us, that even when the order has been permuted, there is still a high chance of having the Numerical run for a very long time for the first case. In this case it is around 7 hours. It is also very interesting to note that the Error Bar is very small, meaning that the permutation of the order does not guarantee that a fast solution can be found}

\subsection{Analysis}

\subsubsection{Sequential Numbers}
In Section \ref{combined_sequential} it is clear that, not only is the Geometrical algorithm more stable than the Numerical algorithm, but I would also argue that, for this instance, it is the preferable algorithm. Even if we were to use somehow could exclude the extreme cases, we would only save 3 minutes by using the Numerical algorithm. Clearly it is not worth risking about 12 hours of run-time for that. 

\subsubsection{Random Numbers}
The result in Section \ref{non-sorted_random_results} This result is actually rather surprising. Since the random numbers tend to be rather large (since they lie between 1 and $2^{32} - 1$), I would have expected the Geometrical solution to be slower, since more Event Points would have had to be created, inserted and removed from the Event Queue, before any of the Runners could enter the Zone. The fact that there are no calculations by the Numerical algorithm that took over 1 second is not that surprising, given that completely random speeds were being used for the tested configurations.\\

\subsubsection{Prime Numbers}

In Section \ref{non-random_prime_results} it is interesting to note that the speed is slightly slower than in Section \ref{random_prime_results}, where the runner speeds had been randomized, clearly showing that the order of the inputs matter.\\

\ref{combined_prime}
Based on the above 2 tables, it seems clear to me that the Prime numbers contain properties that makes the Numerical algorithm more suitable. It is also clear that none of the algorithms is able to find a solution right away, but rather has to work on it. 


\subsubsection{Total Results}
From Section \ref{total_combined_results} it seems clear that using the Geometrical algorithm would be the best choice. In the best case it is much faster than the Numerical algorithm, and in the worst case it only takes about 30 min more than the Numerical algorithm. The risk of having the Numerical algorithm spend hours trying to find a solution for a single configuration makes such small saving irrelevant.  

Another fact worth noting is that while both the Numerical and the Geometrical algorithm have near the same number of calculations that takes more than 1 second, but clearly the time taken by the Numerical ones must take far longer, in for the Numerical solution to be the fastest when these are not counted.

From the above graphs it would seem tempting to assume that the Numerical algorithm was dramatically better than the Geometrical, even if we included the extreme times reported, however a closer look shows that the truth is more complicated than that. The below table and calculations are based on all the reported speeds:

%\input{./data/tables/speed_table.tex}

While it from the graphs would seem clear that the Numerical algorithm is faster for most of the instances. 
I believe the reason for this to belong to the fundamental differences of the 2 algorithms. While both algorithms are based on exploring all possible candidates times for a time where equation \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner} is true, the Geometrical algorithm works by sweeping through the entire first round of the final runner\footnote{The runner with speed 1}, while the Numerical algorithm often is less methodical about it, depending on the 2 selected runner speeds, trying time points against equation \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner}. In practice it is clear this is a better approach than the Geometrical algorithm.
 
It however also clear that for some configurations (even when accounting for the spread), finding a time where equation \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner} is true, takes much more time than most of the other configurations for that number of runners. Two good examples of this are \figureref{Primes_1000_Geo} and \figureref{Sequential-Random_1000_Geo}. The best explanation I have been able to come up with for cases like the first is that equation \eqaref{eqa:lonelyRunner} depends not so much on the size of the numbers, but rather on the on the number of the runners and the interaction of the runners speeds. I believe cases like the second are caused by the input based run-time of the Numerical algorithm - if the order of the runner speeds are in such a way that a good part of list has to be searched through, then the Numerical algorithms run-time of $O(k * n^3)$ (as proved back in Section \ref{proof_num} on page \pageref{proof_num}) begins to show itself.

\subsection{Conclusion}

From the above it is clear that the Numerical algorithm is faster than the Geometrical. It is also clear from the graphs that neither of the algorithms are entirely stable, and for some configurations have both a very large execution time spread. As I have not been able to find a pattern for the configurations that have produced some of these abnormalities, I can
