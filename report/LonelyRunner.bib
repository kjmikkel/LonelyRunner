@book{citeulike:3347056,
    abstract = {This well-accepted introduction to computational geometry is a textbook for
high-level undergraduate and low-level graduate courses. The focus is on
algorithms and hence the book is well suited for students in computer science
and engineering. Motivation is provided from the application areas: all
solutions and techniques from computational geometry are related to particular
applications in robotics, graphics, CAD/CAM, and geographic information
systems. For students this motivation will be especially welcome. Modern
insights in computational geometry are used to provide solutions that are both
efficient and easy to understand and implement. All the basic techniques and
topics from computational geometry, as well as several more advanced topics,
are covered. The book is largely self-contained and can be used for self-study
by anyone with a basic background in algorithms.

In this third edition, besides revisions to the second edition, new sections
discussing Voronoi diagrams of line segments, farthest-point Voronoi diagrams,
and realistic input models have been added.},
